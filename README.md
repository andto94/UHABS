# UHABS Navigation Module and Simulation

## Overview

This navigation sub-system was designed for autonomous guidence of the UHABS ocean recovery module. While we have not got to ocean testing, we have created a simulation for proof-of-concept.

In future iterations of this project, this code can be adapted for live use with the substitution of driver and telemetry code.

## Usage

While each of the modules can be used independently, we have included a full simulation through the **run_boat.py** and **run ground_station.py** scripts. These can be configured with the provided YAML template.
